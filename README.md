### Simple RL Agent and Environment.

A dummy implementation of a reinforcement learning problem
with a dummy environment and a simple agent.

Just run:-
```
$ python3 simple_rl_agent_environment.py
```

Install conda and create a virtual environment to install gymnasium
and other corresponding gymnasium environments. Just use python version 3.9
because of compatibility issues arising from being able to use different
environments from ALE.
```
$ conda create --name deep_rl_python_3.9 python=3.9
$ conda activate deep_rl_python_3.9
$ pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Now run the following scripts:-
1) `simple_gymnasium_rl_agent.py`: Shows the use of gymnasium library to code up your first RL agent.
```
$ python3 simple_gymnasium_rl_agent.py
```

2) [WIP] `gan_atari_image_synthesis.py`: A GAN based model used to generate Atari images using the ALE evironment for different Atari games, specifically 10 popular games - `Breakout`, `Alien`, `Atlantis`, `Robotank`, `Pitfall`, `VideoCube`, `VideoCheckers`, `BattleZone`, `Qbert`, and `KungFuMaster`.
```
python gan_atari_image_synthesis.py
```
Sample images from tensorboard where `real` corresponds to the real Atari games' images and `fake` corresponds to the images generated by the network after some number of iterations.
